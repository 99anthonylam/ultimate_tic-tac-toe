# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Introduction
For our CS591 Game Theory project, we implemented Minimax with Alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search to determine the age old question of two player games applied to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe: Should you go first or second? 

Helpful game rules and illustrations can be found [here](https://ultimate-t3.herokuapp.com/rules).

## Usage

In order to run and play against our agents, clone the git repo and run the respective drivers located in `./MCTS/driver.py` for MCTS and `./Main.py` for Minimax. Customization and play parameters can be found in their respective file comments.

Have fun!
